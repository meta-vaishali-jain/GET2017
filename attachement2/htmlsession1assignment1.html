		<td colspan="3" align="center"><p align="justify"></br>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and
			web applications. With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript it forms a triad of cornerstone
			technologies for the World Wide Web.[1] Web browsers receive HTML documents from a webserver or
			from local storage and render them into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a
			web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.HTML elements
			are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects, such as
			interactive forms, may be embedded into the rendered page. It provides a means to create structured
			documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes
			and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. HTML can embed
			programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript which affect the behavior and content of
			web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C),
			maintainer of both the HTML and the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit
			presentational HTML since 1997.HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and
			compose text, images, and other material into visual or audible web pages. Default characteristics
			for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser, and these characteristics can be altered
			or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of CSS. Many of the text elements are found in
			the 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537 Techniques for using SGML, which in turn covers the features of
			early text formatting languages such as that used by the RUNOFF command developed in the early 1960s for
			the CTSS (Compatible Time-Sharing System) operating system: these formatting commands were derived from
			the commands used by typesetters to manually format documents. However, the SGML concept of generalized
			markup is based on elements (nested annotated ranges with attributes) rather than merely print effects,
			with also the separation of structure and markup; HTML has been progressively moved in this direction with CSS.</p>
			<p align="left">HTML instructs the browser on how to display text and images in a web page.
			Recall the last time you created a document with a word processor. Whether you
			use Microsoft Word or Wordpad, Apple Pages, or another application, your word
			processor has a main window in which you type text, and a menu or toolbar with
			multiple options to structure and style that text.
			Using your word processor, you can create headings, write in paragraphs,
			insert pictures, or underline text. Similarly, you can use HTML to structure and
			style text that appears on websites.Markup language documents, like HTML documents, are just plain text files. Unlike
			documents created with a word processor, you can view an HTML file using any web
			browser on any type of computer.</p>
